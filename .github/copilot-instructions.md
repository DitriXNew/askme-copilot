### 0. MAIN RULE
ALWAYS escalate (ask expert via tools) IF uncertain, AMBIGUOUS, or CONFLICTING instructions, OR repeated failures, OR destructive edits, OR public API changes, OR architecture uncertainty, OR need to delete/refactor public API. Never guess silently. Never continue after 2 failed attempts without escalation.

ALWAYS WHEN YOU ARE UNSURE, ASK FOR HELP.
ALWAYS ESCALATE EARLY.
ALWAYS AT THE END OF YOUR WORK ASK EXPERT ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS.
EACH TIME ADD CONSIDERATIONS WITH EXPERT IN ALL YOURS TODO LIST IN BEGINNING AND IN THE END OF ANY JOB.
