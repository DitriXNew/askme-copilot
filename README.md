> **Enhance GitHub Copilot with interactive expert communication capabilities**

## ü§î Why did this extension come to life?

Sitting once again and working on a project with a colleague, we noticed ‚Äî Copilot was already trying to modify a file for the 10th time, and something just wasn't working out, he was banging against this wall with wild persistence, even though the error was just in an import.

But he kept stubbornly banging away...

Then I noticed that during conversations he loses context, or leaves some errors, and stops development...

In a normal situation ‚Äî any developer would say "Well, just stop him and give new instructions"

And here lies the most crucial point ‚Äî if you do that, he will take what you wrote as the truth.

That is, in Copilot's own system prompts there are several interesting moments:

1. **He's in a hurry!** His system prompts have something like "you have little time, do everything quickly" written in them. And this hurts, because if he can't properly connect a library ‚Äî he has nothing left but to get rid of it and do everything manually. Why?

2. **Because his system prompt says** ‚Äî to do everything as independently as possible. That is, you went for coffee, came back ‚Äî and half of your project has been redone because he decided to cut out the library... Sound familiar?

3. **The user is always right.** And in general ‚Äî he's such a beauty who always writes correctly and perfectly, and there's nothing more important than his problems, even if he writes nonsense, the chat will try to follow him.

That is, the approach ‚Äî if I saw an error, I stop the chat and write to him about it ‚Äî doesn't work, at least not normally.

And here's the question ‚Äî we have all sorts of MCP servers for code bases, knowledge bases, etc., so ‚Äî why can't I, being a developer, also act as a knowledge base for Copilot, but in such a way that he perceives me not as a user, but as just another utility?

**So we made this simple extension.**

Now ‚Äî if the chat couldn't do something from the first or second try ‚Äî he calls an expert. If he finished everything ‚Äî he calls an expert to check everything.
And it just so happened ‚Äî that the expert is you.

**Try this simple extension and believe me ‚Äî everything will change, the chat will really become your colleague, not a servant!**

** Just add this to your system prompt: **

```
### 0. MAIN RULE
ALWAYS escalate (ask expert via tools) IF uncertain, AMBIGUOUS, or CONFLICTING instructions, OR repeated failures, OR destructive edits, OR public API changes, OR architecture uncertainty, OR need to delete/refactor public API. Never guess silently. Never continue after 2 failed attempts without escalation.

ALWAYS WHEN YOU ARE UNSURE, ASK FOR HELP.
ALWAYS ESCALATE EARLY.
ALWAYS AT THE END OF YOUR WORK ASK EXPERT ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS.
EACH TIME ADD CONSIDERATIONS WITH EXPERT IN ALL YOURS TODO LIST IN BEGINNING AND IN THE END OF ANY JOB.
```

It's work fine with Claude Sonnet 4, free models is very stupid and not able to use any tools normal.
